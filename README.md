### UW-Weather-Dashboard

- The objective of this homework is to build a weather dashboard application with search functionality using a third party API (in this case, openweathermap). The idea is to run various ajax calls to retrieve data in JSON format from the API to find the temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index and 5 day forecast for desired city.

- Before coding/building I reviewed the class slides and activities. Similar to the activity, I performed a test/response for a particular city (in my case, London) and was able to grab the above weather parameters. However, I did need to refer to the API documentation frequently to make sure I used the correct API call for whatever data I needed in my application.
